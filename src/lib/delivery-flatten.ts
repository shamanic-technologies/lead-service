/**
 * Flattening one email-gateway status answer down to the scope a read is about.
 *
 * email-gateway keys its evidence on the campaign that SENT, and answers a brand-mode question
 * with a per-campaign breakdown (`byCampaign`) beside the brand roll-up. Everything here is a way
 * of collapsing that answer: to the brand, to one campaign, to a campaign IDENTITY's members, or
 * to one campaign identity nested under a brand-scoped row (see campaign-breakdown.ts). Merging
 * across the two providers (broadcast + transactional) is common to all of them, which is why it
 * lives in one module rather than beside any one caller.
