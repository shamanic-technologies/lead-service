/**
 * Name, for a set of lead rows, the OFFER each one belongs to — brand-service's proposition level,
 * which sits between the brand and the campaign (Org > Brand > Offer > Campaign).
 *
 * lead-service defines NONE of an offer's semantics and holds no offer column. The resolution is
 * the one offer scope already established next door (offer-campaigns-client.ts), read in the other
 * direction:
 *
 *     a lead's offer = the offer named by the campaign the lead was served under.
 *
 * `leads_campaigns.campaign_id` is that attribution, frozen at serve time, and campaign-service
 * records each campaign's offer (`campaigns.offer_id`). So a row's offer follows from a column the
 * row already carries — never re-derived from its brand, its funnel, or a sibling campaign, and
 * unaffected by the campaign being reconfigured afterwards, which is why the attribution was frozen
 * in the first place. The offer's NAME is brand-service's (`/internal/brands/{brandId}/offers`);
 * nothing is invented or cached here.
 *
 * PER REQUEST, NEVER PER ROW. A brand's leads list reaches tens of thousands of rows and is polled
 * every 30 seconds, so a lookup per row (or even per chunk) would be the whole cost of the feature.
 * Both reads are therefore memoized on this resolver, which the route builds once per request:
 *
 *   - ONE campaign-service `/campaigns` read for the org, whatever the row count. It answers
 *     campaign -> offer for every campaign in the org at once, exactly as the offer FILTER's read
 *     does, so a hundred chunks share one call.
 *   - ONE brand-service offers read per BRAND actually seen, and only for brands whose campaigns
 *     name an offer. A brand-scoped list — what the dashboard reads — is one call; an org-wide
 *     staff read is one per brand it actually returned rows for, not one per row.
 *
 * FAIL-SOFT, with a loud log, like the campaign IDENTITY resolver and unlike the offer FILTER.
 * The distinction is what the failure DOES. The filter decides which rows come back, so failing it
 * open would serve the whole brand's people under one offer's name — wrong data, so it 502s. This
 * decides what one DISPLAY field on a row says; unresolved, the field is absent and the row still
 * carries the `campaignId` the offer is derived from. Degraded, never wrong — and a read that works
 * today must not start failing because a field was added to it.
 *
 * So `offer` is null when the campaign names no offer AND when we could not ask, the second always
 * accompanied by a `console.error`. It is NEVER a guess: no brand, no funnel and no sibling
 * campaign is ever substituted for an offer the campaign did not itself name.
