/**
 * What the OUTREACH provider holds about one person: the messages exchanged with them, the reply
 * statements a human recorded about them, and the opt-outs a human recorded for them.
 *
 * All three live in instantly-service, which owns them; none of them is re-derived here. The
 * messages are read from that service's own mirror of the provider's mailbox — the copy that
 * survives the provider's plan being cancelled — so this client never talks to the provider and
 * nothing here breaks when the subscription ends.
 *
 * NOTHING THROWS FOR A TRANSPORT FAILURE. A source that cannot answer returns
 * `{ ok: false, reason }` and the history read states it as unreachable, because "we could not
 * read this" and "this did not happen" are different facts and collapsing them would tell a
 * customer their prospect said nothing. A source failing must not take the whole answer down.
