/**
 * A website visit the DELIVERY LAYER already measured.
 *
 * A visit is measured automatically as a CLICK on the email we sent: email-gateway owns that
 * evidence, and nothing here changes what it measures or how a click is attributed. A human can
 * now state a visit too (`website_visit`, `src/lib/step-statements.ts`), because the automatic
 * signal misses — but the two describe the SAME step, so a lead carrying both must be counted
 * once, not twice.
 *
 * The join is only possible here: lead-service is what knows lead → brand → registered email, and
 * it is what asks email-gateway for delivery evidence everywhere else. So the guarantee is applied
 * where the two facts meet — a hand-stated visit is SUPPRESSED from the outcome reads when the
 * delivery layer already measured a click for that lead's registered email at brand scope. What a
 * consumer reads for `website_visit` is therefore the visits known ONLY by hand: the number it can
 * ADD to the measured click count without double-counting anybody.
 *
 * A lead with no registered email is never suppressed — the measured signal keys on the email, so
 * such a lead cannot be in the measured set at all and counting it cannot double-count.
 *
 * email-gateway unreachable is FAIL-LOUD (the caller answers 502): a guess in either direction is
 * a wrong number nothing would ever go red about.
